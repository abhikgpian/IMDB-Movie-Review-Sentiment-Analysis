## 🎬 IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project implements a deep learning model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). An interactive Streamlit web app is also developed for real-time sentiment prediction.

## 📌 Features
🔹 Built a deep learning model with Embedding layers and Simple RNN for binary sentiment classification.
🔹 Preprocessed text data using word index encoding and padded sequences to ensure uniform input length.
🔹 Developed an interactive Streamlit app for real-time sentiment prediction on user-entered reviews.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas
Streamlit
IMDB Dataset (Keras built-in)
